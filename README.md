  The main cause of flood in Chennai is improper maintenance of drainage system. So the
motive of our project is to focus on monitoring water resources, drainage system of an area and
alerting the danger zones.

  In order to monitor the water resources, we consider the inflow and outflow of a particular
water body. The inflow and outflow of waterbodies are periodically recorded. The software to be
developed will use this periodically recorded data to predict the forthcoming outflow that could
cause flood and also notify when the water bodyâ€™s inflow is from some other source.

  To monitor the drainage system, the terrain information of the locality available in Google maps
is used. The overall drainage system of the city will be monitored. The software will notify whenever
an hindrance occurs in a path that blocks water flow.

  The continuous monitoring information is collected and used for future prediction and it is also
used for alerting the danger zones. So, whenever the outflow reaches a threshold or on notification
of hindrance in drainage, the outflow velocity is calculated and most probable areas of danger are alerted
